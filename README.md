# 👋 Hi there, I’m Nurbol Sultanov

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m an aspiring **Infrastructure Engineer** based in Los Angeles, CA. I originally created this GitHub profile while studying full-stack web development at **Microverse**, where I collaborated on projects with international peers and contributed to open-source-style team work.

While most of my public repositories were created during that period of software engineering training, my **professional experience actually began in IT infrastructure** — long before I started learning GitHub. I worked with enterprise systems in both **corporate (Kazatomprom)** and **small business** environments, supporting virtual machines, servers, networks, and automation systems.
